Provide implementation for the functions:
-- private static void Reverse(byte[] values)
-- private static void Reverse(long[] values)

Each of these function must reverse bits in the each element of "values" array.

It is important that both these function will execute as quickly as possible. 
Memory consumption is not a concern (but must be reasonable, so that a regular PC could execute the code).
