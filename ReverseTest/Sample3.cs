     * Given a 1000X1000 grayscale image where each pixel is 8 bits, you need to reverse the order of the bits in each pixel. 
     * Example: 10001101 becomes 10110001, 00111101 becomes 10111100 and so on. Provide the most efficient solution 
     * in the manner of performance because another input is that you need to handle many images per second.
