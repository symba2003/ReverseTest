Provide implementation for the functions:
-- private static void Reverse(byte[] values)
-- private static void Reverse(long[] values)

It is important that both these function will execute as quickly as possible. 
Memory consumption is not a concern (but must be reasonable, so that a regular PC could execute the code).
